# Exercise 3 - Variable for numbers

# Assigning numbers to a varibale/

weight = 70

weight + 25

# Numbers vs Strings

height = "170"  # height is a string
age = 25        # age is a number

# Using variable in calculations

original_num = 23
new_num = original_num + 7
print(new_num)   #output: 30

#Using Multiple Variables in a Calculation

original_num = 23
num_to_be_added = 7
new_num = original_num + num_to_be_added
print(new_num)           # Output: 30

#Variables as Their Own New Value

original_num = 90
original_num = original_num + 10
print(original_num)      # Output: 100

#Variables Can Change Types

your_age = "21"          # Now `your_age` is a string
your_age = 21            # Now `your_age` is a number

#Naming Variables with Numbers

# Incorrect:
#1st_prime_number = 2     # Starts with a number - not allowed

# Correct:
prime_number_1st = 2     # Number comes after the letters - allowed

#Integer and Float Variables

temperature = 37.5       # Float
balance = -100.75        # Float
percentage = 0.003       # Float
