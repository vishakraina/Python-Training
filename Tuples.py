# Example of a Tuple for State Order

states_in_order_of_founding = ("Delaware", "Pennsylvania", "New Jersey", "Georgia")

# Example of Defining a Tuple:

states_in_order_of_founding = ("Delaware", "Pennsylvania", "New Jersey", "Georgia")


# Accessing Tuple Elements

second_state_founded = states_in_order_of_founding[1]
print("The second state founded was " + second_state_founded)
# Output: The second state founded was Pennsylvania

# Example of Redefining a Tuple

states_in_order_of_founding = ("Delaware", "Taylorswiftsylvania formerly known as Pennsylvania", "New Jersey", "Georgia")


# Defining a Tuple:

colors = ("red", "green", "blue")

# Accessing Tuple Elements:

first_color = colors[0]
# Output: first_color = "red"

# Redefining a Tuple:

colors = ("red", "green", "blue", "yellow")  # Adds "yellow" by redefining the tuple
