# Topic 15 - Lists

# Example of Individual Variables:

city_0 = "Atlanta"
city_1 = "Baltimore"
city_2 = "Chicago"
city_3 = "Denver"
city_4 = "Los Angeles"
city_5 = "Seattle"


# A better way is to use a list:

cities = ["Atlanta", "Baltimore", "Chicago", "Denver", "Los Angeles", "Seattle"]

# 1. Defining a List

cities = ["Atlanta", "Baltimore", "Chicago", "Denver", "Los Angeles", "Seattle"]

# 2. Accessing Elements in a List

print("Welcome to " + cities[3])  # Output: Welcome to Denver

# 3. Lists with Different Data Types

mixed_things = [1, "Bob", "Now is"]
print(mixed_things[0])  # Output: 1
print(mixed_things[1])  # Output: Bob
print(mixed_things[2])  # Output: Now is
